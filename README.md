# Jean-Clugston-Website

Complete site from scratch (using some styles from original)

The goal of this project is to update and reformat the code so that the site will be easier to edit and manage in the future by anyone.

Stretch goals include:
Javascript based loading animations for images and text
Seperate database for image storage
Login for direct access of image and text change
Text fields for contact info/direct message to the artist
